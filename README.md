# QLearningMaze

A Q-learning demo of finding path in a maze.

MazeView is not necessary so you can comment it out to speed up if you don't need to see the learning process.

Inspired by [A Painless Q-learning Tutorial](http://mnemstudio.org/path-finding-q-learning-tutorial.htm) and [Q_Learning_maze](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow/tree/master/contents/2_Q_Learning_maze).
